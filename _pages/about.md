## Andrew C. Freeman, computer science educator

I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Before that, I got a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama. And before that, I grew up near Dallas, Texas.

My research focuses on multimedia systems. I'm working on bringing an innovative, asynchronous camera sensor to fruition and hoping it will change the paradigm for deep-space astronomy.

Upon graduation, I plan to begin a teaching-oriented career at a small, liberal arts school.

This site was built on Jekyll with the <a href="https://github.com/ronv/ultra">Ultra</a> theme, hosted on GitHub Pages.
