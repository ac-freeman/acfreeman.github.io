## Andrew C. Freeman, computer science educator

I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Before that, I got a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama. And before that, I grew up near Dallas, Texas.

My research focuses on multimedia systems. I'm exploring asynchronous event representations for video, event compression, and event applications.

Upon graduation, I plan to begin a teaching-oriented career at a small, liberal arts school.

This site was built on Jekyll with the <a href="https://github.com/ronv/ultra">Ultra</a> theme, hosted on GitHub Pages.
