### Music
- 6/26/21: [Mood Valiant - Hiatus Kaiyote (Spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/album/456WeVeZk38VJuqg2sL7QG?si=i85bbCaMQjevYckwqA9myw&dl_branch=1) An album I've impatiently waited 6 years for. Across the buttery smootheness of "And We Go Gentle" and "Red Room," the more traditionally wild tracks "Get Sun" and "Chivalry Is Not Dead," the Scotch snaps in "All The Words We Don't Say," the dissonant and oddly syncopated "Rose Water" and "Sparkle Tape Break Up," the emotional ballad "Stone Or Lavender"... there's so much different stuff to love here.
- [★ Jazz and things playlist (Spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/43EEnlpxXMjQ2aPZVUQL15?si=743fe02876cf4988) My go-to playlist, basically all the music I regularly enjoy. >200 hours and counting.
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzFAR6aN20g&feature=youtu.be">Tigran Hamasyan Quintet - VARDAVAR (Montreux Jazz Fest. 2014)</a>
- [Thundercat, JD Beck, DOMi, and Ariana Grande - Them Changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxKsIBkvRsA&ab_channel=gettnastyyonins) The one song with Ariana Grande I can stand to listen to.
