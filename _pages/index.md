## Andrew C. Freeman, computer science researcher and educator

I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Before that, I got a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama. And before that, I grew up near Dallas, Texas.

My research focuses on multimedia systems. I'm exploring asynchronous event representations for video, event compression, and event applications.

Upon graduation, I plan to begin a teaching-oriented career at a small, liberal arts school.

This site was built on Jekyll with the <a href="https://github.com/ronv/ultra">Ultra</a> theme, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Mentoring & Collaboration

### Undergraduate/Graduate Students
During my time at UNC, I have had the pleasure of working with and mentoring many other students/academics in research. Some of those students include:

- Eric Schneider (MS student)
- Noah Green (BS student)
- Finn Stewart James (BS student)
- Chris Burgess (MS student)
- Felipe Chiavegatto (BS student)
- Rahul Patel (PhD student, [Zylka Lab](http://zylkalab.org/people))

In addition, I led four teams of undergraduate learning assistants during my first two years of graduate school.

### Polygence (High School Students)
I mentor high school research projects through the <a href="https://www.polygence.org/">Polygence</a> platform.

Students mentored for full research projects:

- Jyotsna Raghavan, _Cornell University Class of 2027_
- Rishit Shiramshetti

Through the Polygence Pathfinders program, I have also mentored 10+ high school students in discussing the world of computer science studies, job opportunities, research, and college applications.

## Statement of Values
As a covenant member of the Summit Church, I hold to the [Baptist Faith and Message](https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/).

I believe in the sanctity of all life, including the lives of the unborn. I believe there is objective morality and that the ultimate purpose of our lives is to know God and make him known.

I regularly support the Summit Church and the International Mission Board with my charitable donations.
