My work on developing an asynchronous camera sensor emulator was just published in the proceedings of the ACM Multimedia 2020 conference. I presented the work remotely this week, and was pleasantly surprised to receive the conference award for Best Demo! Both the paper write-up and demo video are available on ACM DL <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394171.3414394" targe="_blank">here</a>.
