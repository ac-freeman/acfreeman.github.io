I'm happy to announce that my advisors and I are receiving a grant to support our research for the calendar year 2022. The funding body is the North Carolina State University's [Laboratory for Analytic Science](https://ncsu-las.org/about/) (LAS), which is a joint program of NC State and the National Security Agency. My research for this grant will involve applying my asynchronous video processing methods to "triage" large-scale video data. The grant will cover my stipend, part of my advisors' salaries, hardware expenses, conference travel expenses, and a stipend for a motivated undergraduate student. 

Video "triage" is the process of searching a video corpus for the information you're interested in. Take this example: if there's a bank robbery, an analyst would want to be able to quickly search through a lot of surveillance footage from many sources to find the exact segments that show the robbery taking place. It's an interesting problem that I'm excited to tackle. Beyond advancing the development of my video processing methods, this will also give me the opportunity (and the motivation) to implement a full system with networked video streaming capabilities, something I've always wanted to do but never had time for. After working as a teaching assistant my first two years of grad school, I'm excited that my research is now gaining enough momentum that I can secure funding from a couple sources. This will make it much easier to focus on research from here on out, and hopefully allow me to finish my degree in a reasonable amount of time.
