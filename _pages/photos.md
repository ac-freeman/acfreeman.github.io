I do landscape photography in my free time. It's what drives much of my research. If you would like to express your support, I have at-cost prints (AKA I don't earn money) and digital downloads of my work available for sale <a href="https://www.acfreeman.photo/" target="_blank">here</a>. You can also follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/acfreeman.photo/" targe="_blank">Instagram</a>.
